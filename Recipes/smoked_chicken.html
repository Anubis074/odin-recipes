        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>wood chips of choice, soaked in water</li>
            <li>water as needed</li>
            <li>3.5 pound whole chicken</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons freshly cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directons</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a smoker to 250 degrees F (120 degress C)</li>
            <li>Combine paprika, chili powder, cayenne, black pepper, thyme, garlic<br>
            powder, onion powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl and mix<br>
            completely with a fork until well combined.</li>
            <li>Spatchcock the chicken by placing chicken, breast side down, on a work<br>
            surface. Starting at the tail end, cut along both sides of backbone with<br>
            kitchen shears. Remove backbone. Grabbing hold of both sides of the<br>
            chicken, open it like a book. Turn breast side up. Push down on each side<br>
            of breast with your hands until you hear it crack. Flatten. Rub with the<br>
            seasoning blend.</li>
            <li>Smoke (wood chips of choice) until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the<br>
            thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, reads 140 degrees F(60 degrees C), about 3<br>
            1/2 hours. Turn up the heat to 350 to 400 degrees F (175 to 200 degrees C) and get<br>
            direct heat on the skin to finish out with an internal temperature of 160 degrees F<br>
            (71 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, cover in foil, and allow to rest until the internal<br>
            temperature reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 10 minutes. Cut<br>
            and serve.</li>
        </ol>
